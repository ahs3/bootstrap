<title> Fedora Bootstrap </title>

<h1 align=center> Fedora Bootstrap </h1>

<p> These two scripts are designed to help you bootstrap Fedora to a
new architecture.  Generally, one Fedora release is built upon the
previous release, but this cannot be done for a new platform - you
must cross-compile enough packages to "bootstrap" the new platform.
This can be a tricky endeavor, and these scripts try to do it for you.

<p> There are a few convenience functions in the scripts that you may
wish to edit and take advantage of.  Search for the "sync" module that
rsync's the rootfs to a running target as /hardfp for one example.
Also, the first section of the stage1 script has some variables that
define the target you're building for.

<p> The stage1 script is run first.  It expects a symbolic link in the
current directory called "SRPMs" that points to a directory full of
SRPMS.  You may also have a link SRPMlocal that points to a directory
with local SRPMs; any SRPM in the local directory will be used instead
of a corresponding one in the SRPMs directory - this is most likely
going to be a board-specific kernel, for example.

<p> Stage1 will take a long time to build, but will eventually produce
a cross-development toolchain and a bootable rootfs.  How you turn
that rootfs tree into a bootable media depends on the board; this
script targets SDcard-based OMAP boards, and creates both MLO and
uboot in the /boot/ subdirectory in the rootfs, which you would need
to copy to the FAT partition where the OMAP chip expects to find them.

<p> Stage1 will also pre-populate your rootfs image with all the
sources needed for stage2, so expect the rootfs to be large.

<p>Stage2 is run on the new platform.  Boot stage1, cd to /stage2, and
run the stage2 script.  It should take even longer and build even more
packages.  When done, you should have a platform on which you can run
"rpmbuild" for the remainder of the packages you need.
