-- During stage1, found it necessary to add -rpath ${ROOTFS}/lib to several
   of the build steps; is this a libtool bug or what?  And does it matter?

-- When the stage1 script builds distccd.script, it picks up 127.0.0.1
   as my hostname IP address.  While technically correct, it's not very
   useful.  Granted my network setup is a little odd out of necessity,
   is there some way to accomodate this better?
