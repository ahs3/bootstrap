-- During stage1, found it necessary to remove the line:

        +_libc_intl_domainname D 0x5

   from the patch for the glibc source file:
   
        glibc-ports/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/aarch64/nptl/libc.abilist

   This is Not A Good Thing.  It needs to go back, and we need to understand
   why the final link for glibc fails in stage1 when that line is present in
   that file; the failure is reported by ld as a relocation it cannot figure
   out.

-- During stage1, found it necessary to add -rpath ${ROOTFS}/lib to several
   of the build steps; is this a libtool bug or what?  And does it matter?
